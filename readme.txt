Social Media Monitoring: Show off how your brand name is talked about globally.

== Description ==
Show off how much your brand name is talked about globally as well as consumer sentiments. All you have to do is to provide a keyword and we start tracking mentions across the web - forums, blogs, Facebook, twitter etc.
