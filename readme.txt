Social Media Monitoring: Show off how your brand name is talked about globally.

== Description ==
Show off how much your brand name is talked about globally as well as consumer sentiments. All you have to do is to provide a keyword and we start tracking mentions across the web - forums, blogs, Facebook, twitter etc.
It's a lot more than just <a href="https://www.socialappshq.com">Social Media Monitoring</a> :-)

You can also show widget below every post by configuring keyword on a per post basis.

= How it works =
On load, Plugin sends a request to <a href="https://www.socialappshq.com">SocialAppsHQ</a> to start crawling the web for a given keyword. We will store the data on our servers and users will see this widget powered from the collected data.
